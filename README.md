# CalendarShare: Functionality

**CalendarShare** enables every signed-in user to simultaneously take on two roles:

1. **Owner of Your Own Calendar**
2. **Authorized User of Shared Calendars**

## As the Owner of Your Own Calendar

As the owner, you possess comprehensive control over your calendar, with the following capabilities:

- **Full CRUD Permissions**: Create, read, update, and delete any events in your calendar, regardless of the creator.

- **Manage Access**:
  - **Add Users**: Add emails of other users to share your calendar. Registered users with these emails can view your calendar in their list of accessible calendars.
  - **Remove Users**: Revoke any user's access by deleting their email from your calendar.

## As an Authorized User of Shared Calendars

As an authorized user accessing calendars shared with you, your permissions include:

- **CRUD Permissions for Your Events**: Create, read, update, and delete any events that you have personally created within the shared calendar.
- **Read-Only Access**: For events created by others, you only have read access.
